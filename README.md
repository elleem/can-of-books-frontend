Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

We will be sure that everyone understands what we are doing and that we are using the driving/steering collaboration model via Code Fellows.

## Conflict Resolution
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

We refuse to let this happen, we will take turns, if we cannot confront each other in a safe team space, then we will ask for help via the instructor.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

We refuse to let this happen, we will take turns, if we cannot confront each other in a safe team space, then we will ask for help via the instructor.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Patience and explaining things and requesting that team members identify when they have questions, since we know that this will have a big impact on the final project.
